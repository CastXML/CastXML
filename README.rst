Build
=====

To build CastXML from source, first obtain the prerequisites:

* A C++ compiler supporting the ``c++11`` standard language level.

* `CMake`_ cross-platform build system generator.

* `LLVM/Clang`_ compiler SDK install tree built using the C++ compiler.
  This version of CastXML has been tested with LLVM/Clang

  - Git ``main`` as of 2024-10-10 (``545e0593f8``)

  - Release ``3.7``
  - Release ``3.6``

* Optionally, the `Sphinx`_ documentation generator to build documentation.

Run CMake on the CastXML source tree to generate a build tree using
a C++ compiler compatible with that used to build the LLVM/Clang SDK.
CMake options include:

``Clang_DIR``
  Location of the LLVM/Clang SDK.  Set to ``<prefix>/lib/cmake/clang``,
  where ``<prefix>`` is the top of the LLVM/Clang SDK install tree.
  Alternatively, ``LLVM_DIR`` may be set to ``<prefix>/lib/cmake/llvm``.

``SPHINX_EXECUTABLE``
  Location of the ``sphinx-build`` executable.
  Required only if building documentation.

``SPHINX_HTML``
  Build documentation in ``html`` format.

``SPHINX_MAN``
  Build documentation in ``man`` format.

Run the corresponding native build tool (e.g. ``make``) in the CastXML
build tree, and optionally build the ``install`` target.  The ``castxml``
command-line tool may be used either from the build tree or the install tree.
The install tree is relocatable.
